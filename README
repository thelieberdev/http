# HTTP 1.1 Server writtin in Go

This is a simple HTTP 1.1 Server written in Go.
You can write your own handlers. Write Trailers and do Chunked Encoding.
There could more be some chunked encoding tests but this project was just for fun.

And tests are not fun...

If you have any questions, contact me. But i don't think there will be any.
